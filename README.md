## D-Pad for Android Devices 

This won't work for every keystrokes, I mainly use as a D-pad for Android devices. While developing Android TV Apps.
I'm sick of using the remote control or laggy virtual D-pad on the screen. -_-

## Requirements

- C Compiler
- adb

> And of course, you need to connect your Android device to your computer via adb first.

## Key Mapping

| Key | Keycode |
| --- | ------- |
| `Left Arrow` | `KEYCODE_DPAD_LEFT` |
| `Right Arrow` | `KEYCODE_DPAD_RIGHT` |
| `Up Arrow` | `KEYCODE_DPAD_UP` |
| `Down Arrow` | `KEYCODE_DPAD_DOWN` |
| `Enter` | `KEYCODE_ENTER` |
| `Space` | `KEYCODE_SPACE` |
| `Backspace` | `KEYCODE_DEL` |
| `Back Tick` | `KEYCODE_BACK` |

## Usage

Compile with your favorite C compiler and run the binary.
