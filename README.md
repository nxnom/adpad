## Pretend as D-Pad for Android TV 

This won't work for every keystrokes, I mainly use as a D-pad for Android devices. While developing Android TV Apps.
I'm sick of using the remote control or laggy virtual D-pad on the screen. -_-

## Requirements

- C Compiler
- adb

> And of course, you need to connect your Android device to your computer via adb first.

## Usage

Compile with your favorite C compiler and run the binary.

## Disclaimer

> This is a quick and dirty hack, so don't expect too much. I spent less than 10 minutes on this. :3
